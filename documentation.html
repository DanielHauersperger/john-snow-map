    The data used by this project comes from <a href='https://khreda.com/teaching/spring22/H517/project1/'>the assignment page</a>, which includes the prompt for the assignment.
    The data includes the locations of the original streets, pumps, and deaths from John Snow's original map of the London 1854 Cholera Epidemic, along with simulated data for when each person died. This simulated data was based on the assumption that the population in this London neighborhood had similar a age breakdown as the US census in 1850.
